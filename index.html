				<p><strong>Vespa, women, and colour</strong> are three elements that go together. The 1980s, more than
					any
					other decade, saw women become the main riders of Vespa. As part of a larger revolution, women took
					charge of
					their fashion by using clothing to express themselves through outfits with super-charged
					colours. This was the decade when women’s fashion aimed to provoke and turn heads.

			<h2>The start of an adventure</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>To express what makes Vespa so <strong>revolutionary and innovative</strong>, requires beginning at
					the origin of the
					brand. Focusing on the year 1946 – when Vespa was founded – reveals all the
					elements which continue
					to make this scooter an icon of style.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Vespa’s creator, Corradino d’Ascanio</strong>, was an ingenious designer with a
					technology-first mentality who blended creativity and mechanical engineering into a functional,
					aerodynamic and simple vehicle.
